## Challenges

    1. We had API trouble
    2. API data was incomplete (so we had to improvise)
    3. html json index errors
    4. Data structures

## How to run the code
  1. Go to branch_s to access the final and completed project
  2. All the important packages needs to be installed beforehand- flask, Bootstrap, json.
  3. To run the program first activate the virutal enviroment in powershell(windows), perform a flask run on the main.py (of branch_s) file and assign debug=1
  4. To make it more accessible to reach the website, we have added a code to directly display the webpage. Run the main.py in Visual Studio Code and follow the link displayed. 


## FAQ

#### Will there be any future work? 

For the future, we will most likely add a user login page, a preferences page that would take preferences from user about the type of animal they would like to adopt, and dispaly the results based on the top adoptions available according to their inputs.
